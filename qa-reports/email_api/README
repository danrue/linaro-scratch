## generating project status email via api

Basic version:
https://qa-reports.linaro.org/api/builds/5811/email/
5811 is the primary key of the build. You can filter/search the build (below)

Version with different template:
https://qa-reports.linaro.org/api/builds/5811/email/?template=4
4 is the primary key of the email template. There is a special value
of this variable = 'default'. This forces using SQUAD's hardcoded
default templates. For some reason this gives ServerError at the
moment. All email templates can be found here:
https://qa-reports.linaro.org/api/emailtemplates/

Full version:
https://qa-reports.linaro.org/api/builds/5811/email/?template=4&output=text/html
If html version exists it will be generated. Otherwise it will be just
text/plain with incorrect mime type.

Filtering build version:
https://qa-reports.linaro.org/api/builds/?version=v4.9.94-165-g9155d55d5cea
This might return more than one entry. In order to limit it to proper
project, you'll need to provide project primary key:
https://qa-reports.linaro.org/api/builds/?version=v4.9.94-165-g9155d55d5cea&project=23

Projects can be filtered the same way:
https://qa-reports.linaro.org/api/projects/?slug=linux-stable-rc-4.9-oe

But you need to find the proper group first:
https://qa-reports.linaro.org/api/groups/?slug=lkft

Searching works similarly to filtering, but it uses predefined set of
fields. So for this use case it's not that useful. You use it by
adding ?search= keyword to API endpoint.

I guess it's worth creating a script for running email preview but I'd
like to finish the external config first. Once this is done, I'll try
to document the options in the API as well.
