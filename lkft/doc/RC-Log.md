- This was the first 4.15 RC.
- Report showed false failures because the new branch was not yet baselined,
  and also because we were running 4.14 kselftest against 4.15.
- 4.15 build was submitted for review but not yet merged when the branch was
  released, causing last minute Friday afternoon scramble (thanks Daniel).
  Should have had it building and baselined ahead of time.
